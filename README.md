# Intro-to-Data-Science---Final-Project
I have been studying Data Science for a semester and I am doing this project to try out the principles of data science using R as discussed in my class. I hope to become more productive with my new data science skills by working on something practical and meaningful.

# Introduction: 
Perhaps one of the most significant purposes of our life is to be happy. But what actually makes us happy? This question has plagued philosophers for years. Fortunately, researchers have made questionnaires worldwide, called “The World Happiness Report”, to further explore the answer to this question through a scientific process. The science of happiness describes personal and national variations in happiness. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments and organizations can use the results to further the policymaking process and assess the progress of countries.

The dataset that I have chosen for this project is their “2019 World Happiness Report”. It ranks 156 countries by their happiness score based on six measurements – economic production (GDP per capita), social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and government corruption. I used the R language and my main focus is to find out the impact of each factor on happiness. As a result, we can focus on improving these factors to accomplish a higher level of happiness. 


# Goals of the project / Research Questions:
1.	To discover which factors are more important for us to live a happier life. 
2.	I intend to discover if there is any trend for different continents. For example, people who live in European countries are always thought to be happier. I hope to examine if this is misinformation. 
3.	I hope to find out any similarities and differences among the countries experiencing the highest or lowest happiness level. 


# Definition of the 9 variables:
•	Happiness Rank: Rank of the country based on the Happiness Score.

•	Country: Name of the country.

•	Happiness Score: A metric measured by asking the sampled people the question: "How would you rate your happiness on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the happiest."

•	GDP per capita: This indicates economic prosperity of each country.  

•	Social support:  This indicates socio-emotional development of the citizens.

•	Healthy life expectancy: This indicates physical health of the citizens.

•	Freedom to make life choices: The national average of binary responses to the GWP question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”

•	Generosity: The shared public values of generosity.

•	Perceptions of corruption: This indicates social trust, including confidence in the honesty of government and business.

# Conclusion
After analyzing the dataset of the Global Happiness Report in 2019, I am able to find out the impact of the different factors in determining the Happiness Score. Now we know that GDP, Social Support, and Healthy Life Expectancy contribute the most in evaluating the happiness level of each country. Interestingly, economic prosperity (GDP) has a significant impact on happiness level only when it is above a certain threshold. It looks like that money makes you happy up to a certain level, however having good health and social support is always important for us to be happier. As economy, physical health, and mental health are significant factors to live happier, governments should value both economic and socio-emotional developments to achieve national progress. 

In addition, I explore the research question deeper by classifying the top 5 and bottom 5 countries in the dataset according to happiness ranking. Countries located in Europe. like Finland, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland, for their citizens, life is decent and happy. Regarding the least happy countries located in Africa and Asia, most people are unhappy perhaps because their most basic needs are far from being satisfied. This thus suggests that countries in the same continent tend to have similar happiness levels and are perhaps affected by similar factors. 
Through this analysis, I am able to answer most of my questions and prove/disprove my hypothesis. Individuals should focus on both physical health and human socio-emotional development. More broadly, if governments and organizations can focus on improving these aspects, it will lead us to achieve a higher level of happiness on personal and global levels.
